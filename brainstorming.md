* *Habits Tracker* which essentially is a bullet point list of all the activites done today. It also would include a like and dislike feature where I can see how I felt doing the activity today.
* *UCD Track Club* is a mobile platform for the UC Davis Track team which I am a part of. It would display weekly workouts by calling Strava's API and upcoming races. It can also make the sign up process much more efficient.
* *Data-Driven education* a online platform that surveys industry professionals regarding relevant skills and connects them to college students for mentorship. I would build the basic layout for this potential platform. 
* *CoachAI* is an application that uses OpenAI's GPT model to answer questions but this app tracks important answers and saves them to billboard for future referencing. 

App Evaluation: Habits Tracker
1. **Mobile:** The app can be more accessible on the phone as it easier to enter daily activties in the day.Its real-time feed of current activity list and it would push like or dislike data to a database.
2. **Story:** The app would bring more control into one's life because having more awareness of our day to day can give us insight on our daily experience. Peers would find it useful as long its not costly meaning time or money.
3. **Market:** The size of our potential user base is all college students in US because the app will be tailored to them. The scale of the app could be the entire digtial world.
4. **Habit:** A frequent user would open this app once a day usually to record all the daily activites done in the day. The user consumes our app through having somewhere to log but what they log into our databases is what they create.
5. **Scope:** The app would prove to be decently challenging since I would need to implement a task feature and a like/dislike user function. The stripped down version of this app is easy to build since its really a glorified bullet point list.

App Evaluation: UCD Track Club
1. **Mobile:** There is much more accessibility and traffic on mobile platforms. Plus, our club has a website and its useful but there's just not enough traffic. This would use location and maps for running routes.
2. **Story:** Very useful because our club uses a multitude of apps including, Strava, Slack, and Instragram but there is no centralized digital headquarters online besides our website. My teamates would be very impressed and thrille about this idea.
3. **Market:** The size of my potential userbase is UCD's runners and the scale is the entire college could visit the app.
4. **Habit:** I check slack for updates about the running club once a day, this app would essentially just migrate that attention towards itself. The average user would consume the schedule and also create the schedule for the app.
5. **Scope:** This app would be very technically challenging because it would use Strava API requests, push navigation, and table views. Yes the prototype should be fun to build. There are certain features that it must have so its clearly defined enough for me.
